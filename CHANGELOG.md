# Changelog

## 1.6.2 — 2026-03-25

Workflow hardening — single CI gate, hook fixes, and config accuracy improvements.

### Fix
- Hooks hardening: config false-positive detection, localhost handshake reliability
- Address review findings: contracts, parsing, and gate accuracy
- Streamline workflow to a single CI gate with clearer role boundaries; remove unused `ci-watch.sh` and `cleanup-branches.sh` scripts

## 1.6.1 — 2026-03-25

Fix Codex review scripts failing in container environments (bwrap unavailable).

### Fix
- Add `agentic_dev_codex_sandbox_args()` to `config.sh` — probes `codex sandbox linux` and returns `-s read-only` when bwrap is available, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` otherwise
- `codex-review.sh` and `codex-review-trivial.sh` now source `config.sh` and use the probe result
- `codex-re-review.sh` fresh-exec fallback path updated to use the probe result

### Fix
- Pre-create `~/.claude` with correct ownership so the volume initializes writable in devcontainers
- Gitignore `settings.local.json` (container-specific, should not be committed)

## 1.6.0 — 2026-03-25

Docker devcontainer and /release automation.

### Developer tooling
- Added: Dockerfile — node:22-slim image with Claude Code, Codex CLI, gh, git, jq; runs as non-root `node` user
- Added: devcontainer.json — VS Code "Reopen in Container" support with claude-code + codespaces extensions; persists `~/.claude` and `~/.config/gh` as named volumes across rebuilds
- Added: docker-compose.yml — consumer project mount, API key passthrough, persisted volumes
- Added: `/release` slash command in CLAUDE.md — Claude determines semver bump from git log, writes changelog entry, calls release script
- Added: `.claude/scripts/release.sh` — bumps plugin.json + marketplace.json + CHANGELOG.md, commits, tags, pushes, creates GitHub release

## 1.5.1 — 2026-03-24

Fix stale review round counter blocking merges on already-approved PRs.

### Review system
- Fixed: Session file `round` resets to 0 when verdict is `approved` — prevents stale counters from a previous fix-review loop from blocking new sessions
- Added: `round_completed` field in session file preserves actual round number for diagnostics
- Added: Review agent Step 0 fast path — when `LAST_VERDICT=approved`, verifies approved Codex comment on PR and skips directly to merge gate
- Changed: Orchestrator reads session file verdict before spawning review agent, passes `LAST_VERDICT` to enable fast path

### Observability
- Added: Codex terminal output streams to configurable `AGENTIC_DEV_CODEX_LOG_PATH` with `tail -f` hint for live monitoring

## 1.5.0 — 2026-03-24

Build command auto-detection, leaner review prompts.

### Configuration
- Changed: Build and E2E commands are now auto-detected from `package.json` scripts instead of requiring `.claude/agentic-dev.json` in consumer repos (closes #27)
- Added: `_detect_pkg_script` helper probes for common script names in decreasing specificity (`test:e2e:full:local` → `test:e2e:full` → `test:e2e` → `e2e`)
- Removed: `_cfg` calls for `testCmd`, `lintCmd`, `buildCmd`, `installCmd`, `devCmd`, `e2eCmd`, `e2eSmokeCmd` — these no longer read from `.claude/agentic-dev.json`
- Changed: Resolution order is now: env var > project config > `package.json` auto-detection > built-in default

### Review system
- Changed: Full and re-review scripts precompute linked issue numbers and inject exact issue-read commands into the Codex prompt
- Changed: Review output format tightened — pass cases explicit, findings use compact bullet shape
- Changed: Re-review prompt trimmed of duplicated instructions; PR body reading made optional

## 1.4.0 — 2026-03-24

Reliability hardening: fail-loud guards, persistent session state, verdict validation, post-rebase CI.

### Core reliability
- Fixed: All four hooks hard-fail (exit 2) when `jq` is missing instead of silently allowing all commands through
- Fixed: Review scripts (`codex-review.sh`, `codex-review-trivial.sh`, `codex-re-review.sh`) exit non-zero when Codex output contains no VERDICT line
- Fixed: Session file paths sanitize `/` to `--` in branch names — slashed names like `fix/foo` no longer create missing subdirectories under `set -e`
- Fixed: Merge gate re-validates CI after auto-rebase changes HEAD — previously a rebased commit could be merged without a green run
- Added: Review scripts persist session state (`CODEX_SESSION_ID`, verdict, round) to `.git/agentic-dev/session-{branch}.json`
- Added: Orchestrator references session state file as authoritative source for review state across context boundaries

### Observability
- Added: Hooks log blocked commands to `.git/agentic-dev/hooks.log` (blocked only — allowed commands are not logged)

### Cleanup
- Changed: Spec agent no longer instructs user to manually copy issue URL — output section matches orchestrator's automated handoff
- Added: `docs/template-contract.md` documenting which PR/issue sections the review prompt and merge gate depend on
- Changed: README simplified — removed redundant config table, tightened prose, added `jq` to prerequisites

## 1.3.0 — 2026-03-24

Path-aware checks, tiered E2E, hardened merge/review workflow.

### Performance
- Added: Path-aware pre-push checks — skips test/lint/build when changed files can't affect them (docs skip everything, test files skip build, style files skip tests)
- Added: Tiered E2E routing (none/smoke/full) — UI-only changes run smoke E2E, core paths run full, docs/config skip entirely
- Changed: `--local-only` cleanup skips remote refresh and GitHub lookups for faster startup (~0.2s)

### Workflow reliability
- Added: Stale base detection — `validate-branch-base` hook rejects local refs behind origin
- Added: Dev agent fetches before worktree creation, branches from `origin/$BASE_BRANCH`
- Added: Auto-symlink `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local` into worktrees
- Added: Project-level config file (`.claude/agentic-dev.json`) — commit settings per-repo
- Added: `ci-watch.sh` — standalone CI polling script replacing inline prompt loops
- Added: Unified CI workflow discovery (`agentic_dev_discover_ci_workflow`) used by merge-gate and ci-watch
- Added: CHANGELOG path auto-detection (`docs/CHANGELOG.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`)
- Changed: Merge gate merges first, then commits CHANGELOG to base branch (eliminates race between concurrent gates)
- Changed: Merge gate retries UNKNOWN mergeability (3× with 5s delay)
- Changed: Merge gate polls in-progress CI runs (up to 10 min) instead of instant-failing
- Changed: Merge gate auto-rebases with `--force-with-lease` on conflicts
- Changed: Merge gate reuses PR metadata in single API call
- Changed: Review agent pushes with `--force-with-lease` after rebase
- Changed: Review agent removed duplicate rebase step (merge gate handles it)

### Review system
- Added: Max review round guard in `codex-re-review.sh` (rejects rounds above `AGENTIC_DEV_MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS`)
- Added: E2E failure triage guidance in review agent (flaky vs regression vs pre-existing)
- Added: Review/merge-gate boundary clarification — gate is authoritative for CI, mergeability, E2E
- Added: Reduced-confidence flag on session resume fallback
- Changed: All review scripts use `--body-file` instead of inline `--body` (prevents truncation)
- Changed: Review scripts delete previous agentic-dev comments before posting (eliminates noise)

### DX
- Changed: Pre-push checks report which step failed with the failing command
- Changed: `cleanup-branches.sh` batches PR API calls (2 calls instead of N)
- Changed: Cleanup skips squash-merge PR lookup in local-only mode

## 1.2.0 — 2026-03-23

Orchestrator agent and smart localhost gate.

- Added: `orchestrator` agent — top-level state machine that owns the full spec → dev → review lifecycle with zero manual handoffs
- Added: Smart localhost gate — auto-detects UI changes instead of asking the user
- Added: Worktree-aware dev server — runs on port 3001 inside the worktree to avoid conflicts
- Added: Spec sync — updates GitHub Issue ACs when localhost review changes scope
- Added: Blocker classification — objective Codex findings auto-fixed, subjective ones require user confirmation
- Changed: `dev` agent slimmed to implementation-only role (triage/review moved to orchestrator)
- Changed: `review` agent inputs/outputs reference orchestrator instead of dev agent
- Changed: Default agent changed from `dev` to `orchestrator`
- Fixed: Inline Codex availability check removed from review and dev agents (already handled inside scripts)

## 1.1.1 — 2026-03-21

Bug fixes.

- Fixed: `validate-commit-message` blocked heredoc-style commits — heredoc check now runs before `-m "..."` extraction, and sed uses `-n .../p` to avoid outputting the raw command on no-match
- Fixed: `pre-push-checks.sh` wrote `.pre-push-passed` to the working tree — sentinel now lives in `.git/`, so it never appears as an untracked file in user projects

## 1.1.0 — 2026-03-20

Configurable setup.

- Added: `init.sh` setup checker — verifies prerequisites, detects build system, scaffolds GitHub templates
- Added: `config.sh` — base branch, build commands, and paths are now configurable via environment variables
- Changed: Non-npm projects supported out of the box (Make, Cargo, Go, Python)
- Changed: Branch cleanup is automatic and local-only on startup
- Changed: Tighter trivial triage and review fix loops
- Fixed: Agent routing uses intent matching instead of slash-command syntax

## 0.1.0 — 2026-03-20
